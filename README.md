# Discord Plugin for CS2

This plugin integrates Discord functionality into your CS2 server, allowing players to get information about the server's Discord community and server stats directly from the game.

## Features

- **Discord Invite Link**: Displays an invite link to your Discord server.
- **Server Stats**: Optionally displays total and online member counts from your Discord server.
- **API Status Check**: Added functionality to check if the Discord API is offline. If the API is down, a custom message is displayed instead of showing the total and online members.
- **API Error Message Configuration**: Customizable error message when the Discord API is not working.
- **Show Link Only on API Error**: Option to show only the Discord invite link when the API is down, hiding member counts.
- **Caching**: Implements caching to reduce server lag and improve performance. Cached server stats and API status are updated every minute.
- **Customizable**: Configurable via a JSON file for easy adjustments.
